There once was a cat named Watch. Watch is jsut an ordinary cat except that he has three tails. Some cultures take animal having more than one tails as omen. Unfortunately, our main character Watch happens to living in one of those cultures. You can certainly say that Watch's live was not an easy one. This is the story of Watch.  
He was unhappy with where he lived. He hated his neighbors and wanted to move to a
quiet place where no one harrassed him about his tail. thus, Watch started
looking for a new place by browsing on the internet. He found a house that
he liked in a few days.

At his new place, he enjoyed private time by playing with yarn and sleeping wherever he wanted. The house had a clock,
a litter box, and everything else a cat needs. This was the most peaceful time of his life. As he was walking around his
living room, he hears a knock on his door. He creeps towards the door and recongizes the voice.
